Automated PR creation via LLM through e.g. Github Issues

This project aims to write an integration between language models like GPT-3 and platforms like Github or Gitlab, such that language models can automatically pick up open issues and create a pull request (or merge request) with the changes needed to solve the issue. This integration would enable developers to significantly reduce the time and effort necessary to complete coding tasks.

## Background

Language models (LLMs) are a subset of artificial intelligence that focus on natural language processing. They are used to process and interpret natural language data. LLMs are used in a variety of applications, such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

GPT-3 is a powerful language model that was developed by OpenAI. It is trained on a massive corpus of text, including the entire contents of Wikipedia. GPT-3 is able to generate text that is almost indistinguishable from human-written text.

## Current TODOs

- Write an integration between language models like GPT-3 and platforms like Github or Gitlab, such that language models can automatically pick up open issues and create a pull request (or merge request) with
