Automated PR creation via LLM through e.g. Github Issues

This project aims to write an integration between LLMs like GPT-3 and platforms like Github or Gitlab, such that LLMs can automatically pick up open issues and create a pull request (or merge request) with the changes needed to solve the issue.
