Automated PR creation via LLM through e.g. Github Issues

This project aims to write an integration between language models like GPT-3 and platforms like Github or Gitlab, such that language models can automatically pick up open issues and create a pull request (or merge request) with the changes needed to solve the issue. This integration would enable developers to significantly reduce the time and effort necessary to complete coding tasks.
